# 📊 Data Analyst Journey — From Raw Data to Real Insights 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Analyst Portfolio Repository**.  
This space represents my journey as a **Data Analyst fresher**, where I transform raw, messy data into **clean, structured, and meaningful insights** using **Python and SQL**.

This repository focuses on the **core foundations every data analyst must master** — data extraction, cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis.

## 🌟 Who Is a Data Analyst?

A Data Analyst is a **problem solver with data**.  
They bridge the gap between raw data and business decisions by:
- Understanding data sources  
- Cleaning and preparing datasets  
- Analyzing trends and patterns  
- Supporting decision-making with insights  

This repository reflects **exactly that mindset** — learning by doing.

## 🔍 What I Do Here (End-to-End Data Analysis)

### 📥 Data Collection & Extraction
- Extract data using **Python** (CSV, Excel, APIs)
- Write **SQL queries** to fetch structured data
- Perform **web scraping** to collect real-world datasets

---

### 🧹 Data Cleaning — The Analyst’s Superpower
Real data is never perfect. I focus heavily on cleaning and preparation:

#### 🔹 Missing Value Handling
- Identify missing data
- Apply mean / median / mode imputation
- Use forward & backward filling where appropriate

#### 🔹 Outlier Detection
- Detect anomalies using the **IQR method**
- Validate outliers with visual tools like boxplots
- Decide whether to remove, cap, or transform values

### 🧠 Feature Engineering & Encoding
Machine learning and analytics require numerical data:

- 🧩 **Label Encoding** – for ordered categories  
- 🎯 **One-Hot Encoding** – for nominal categorical features  
- 📐 **Ordinal Encoding** – preserving meaningful order  
- ⚙️ **Custom Encoding** – domain-based mappings  

---

### 🌐 Web Scraping & Real-World Data
- Scrape data using **BeautifulSoup & Requests**
- Convert raw HTML data into structured DataFrames
- Clean and analyze scraped data for insights

---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand data distributions
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Generate statistical summaries
- Prepare clean datasets for visualization or ML
